## This is not the first article!
### Explanation of the title
This is a **self-referential** sentence, which I imitated from a picture in "Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid" (GEB). "Ceci n'est pas" is French, meaning "This is not..."; this picture is from the painting "The Treachery of Images" (《La trahison des images》) by Belgian artist René Magritte. The painting depicts a pipe, but beneath it is written "Ceci n'est pas une pipe." (This is not a pipe.): ![Image from en.wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg)
Self-description is a very fascinating thing; it can lead to paradoxes and even explain the famous Gödel's theorem...
Later, I found a similar phrase in the flashing slogans on the Minecraft title screen: *Ceci n'est pas une title screen!* (This is not a title screen!).

### But this is indeed my first article
  #### For What?
I will successively write about everything that interests me, such as high-dimensional space, fractal chaos, automata, webgl ......
......
Of course, this also includes interesting things discovered in life or some novel ideas, etc... In short, I will try to make the blog's content richer and more diverse.

To write a successful blog, reader support is definitely essential. I hope everyone can discuss things of common interest together. Finally, special thanks to [HadronCFY (CFY)](https://hadroncfy.com/) for providing me with blog technical support.
### What a coincidence! 2 Anniversaries!
- Tomorrow is also the 120th anniversary of my university ([XJTU](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/))!
- ~~Yesterday was also [Fei Erye's](https://hadroncfy.com/) 4th anniversary of meningitis!~~

Ceci n'est pas la dernière phrase de cet article ? (Isn't this the last sentence of this article?)
<br/>Bien sûr ! Parce que je suis la dernière! (Of course, because I am the last one!)
