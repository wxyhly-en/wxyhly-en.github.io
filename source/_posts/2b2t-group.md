excerpt: While scouting at Y=120 in the Nether, I found a mature tunnel network and ran 100k blocks before returning to spawn. I Joined a Chinese group, helped build an llama dupe base, but it was griefed by FluixCarvin after an insider leak.

After dying last time, I respawned at the bed in our temporary base. After respawning, hadroncfy and I discussed and decided to travel further through the Nether. The Nether terrain is rugged, so we decided to follow others' example and tunnel at y=120, as there's no lava at this height. Shortly after departing, hadroncfy got stuck and disconnected in the Nether. I continued traveling alone in the Nether. After digging for a while, I discovered there's actually a dense tunnel transportation network around y=120! Following it for maybe two hours, I easily ran 100k blocks! I reached 300k! But at this time, the Avengers Alliance group we joined was distributing lots of supplies near spawn. I decided I couldn't go any further. Although I had spent several days arduously reaching 200k, traveling through the Nether would only take a day to return, so I felt it wasn't a loss to go back and return later. So I found a portal, made a bed, placed an ender chest, prepared to sleep, break the bed, and commit suicide. Before suicide, I organized what to put in the ender chest, then typed /kill.
![Death count changed from 1 to 2](/img/2b2t/2019-11-08_20.23.12.jpg)<!--more-->
I respawned on a stone mountain and started auto-pathing to Supply Station #1 posted in the group. On the way, I was killed by a wither - seems auto-pathing isn't as safe as manual travel, as it completely avoids withers. After respawning on another stone mountain, there was a wither advertisement placed by Infinite Force (also a Chinese organization), and a beacon too! I discovered an ender chest nearby - I could take out a diamond pickaxe to mine both the beacon and its diamond block base! But I thought maybe they'd distribute even more supplies later? I abandoned the plan to destroy the beacon and went to collect supplies first.

I walked to Station #1 and from afar could see many chests connected by hoppers arranged like stairs. Why arrange them this way? Because 2b2t has something magical called "stacked kits" - items illegally stacked through technical means, like 64 totems or 64 diamond armor sets. But the server has control plugins that make all stacked items invalid when you open a chest. However, you can use hoppers to extract items. That's right, hoppers are lawless territory - 32k weapons and pig spawners can only be used in hoppers. I saw a player called dtEnglish there, probably from the group too. After confirming I was Chinese, he gave me two shulker boxes!
![](/img/2b2t/2019-11-08_22.06.11.jpg)
But when I opened one box, it only contained some armor and flint & steel. The other box had better items, though I forgot exactly what. There was a bed here, so I slept. While wandering around, hadroncfy also arrived, and dtEnglish gave him some boxes too. Then suddenly dtEnglish pulled out a bow and shot us both dead! I respawned by the bed I just slept in, and he immediately killed me with a sword. After dying and respawning several times like this, I wondered if I was going to be killed for his amusement? Had I encountered labor slavery? (PRThomas's infamous slave labor system on 2b2t - work or be killed repeatedly unless you break your bed and escape)
While thinking this, I respawned on the obsidian platform at spawn. I went to the platform edge and jumped into the water below. hadroncfy hadn't slept, so he said he respawned directly on the obsidian platform. Then dtEnglish privately messaged me saying his brother killed us while he was in the bathroom! When he came back, he found we were all dead. Could I really have such bad luck? Fortunately, my respawn coordinates were outside -2000, so I didn't have to walk far to reach Station #2. On the way, I saw 32K weapons scattered on the ground! Though I knew they were invalid once dropped, I picked them all up as souvenirs.
![](/img/2b2t/2019-11-08_22.30.27.jpg)
Fearing there might be another murderer there, I deliberately slept in a bed before arriving and organized my inventory. Upon reaching Station #2, I found only two ender chests - the other containers were destroyed, with some signs remaining. After placing a shulker box to organize items, when I broke it, it disappeared! I searched everywhere but couldn't find it. There were no other players or hoppers nearby. Could the server's anti-cheat have deleted it because I put 32K items inside? With no choice, I had to leave. After confirming with the group that entering the Nether from Station #2 was safe, I headed through the Nether to Station #5. I disconnected on the way. The group then said Station #5 was also destroyed, indicating there was a mole in the group specifically destroying publicized coordinates. After logging back in, I still went to Station #5 - indeed, nothing was there. The group announced they would distribute firework supplies at Station #4 at 8 PM sharp, but the server suddenly updated, banning all illegal items related to hoppers! This meant the legendary 32k weapons became history (though I later heard 32K could still be used somehow). Since stacked kits required hopper extraction, they also became invalid, making supply transportation difficult. Group leader TBDxxx announced the supply stations would temporarily close to outsiders! I felt incredibly unlucky - coming for supplies right during such a major server update. 32k weapons had existed on the server for years, right? Yesterday 32k still worked, but I happened to come on this exact day? Now I didn't even know where to find supplies. Should I look for bases around spawn? I really started regretting my suicide trip back. Then someone in the group asked if the promised fireworks would still be distributed, and the leader actually said yes! So I'd better wait at Station #4. The leader also said they needed donkeys or llamas for duping, and whoever found them first would get the "Pioneer" title, preferably within 50k blocks. Though it was still early before 8 PM, finding donkeys was too hard since animals are rare. I decided to just return to Station #4 and wait. Just as I was almost at Station #4, hadroncfy told me he had screenshots of llamas we saw during our travels, but without coordinates. Hearing this, I went through my screenshots and found I had recorded the coordinates, and they weren't far!
![Precious coordinates "Llama Screenshot"](/img/2b2t/2019-09-11_16.08.30.jpg)
I immediately privately messaged the leader. Since the screenshot was almost 2 months old, the leader asked me to confirm. I set auto-path in the Nether, and after passing the z-axis highway, I went to eat. When I returned, I found I had already arrived at the destination, standing still without being kicked! Good thing I came back in time. I discovered I didn't have enough obsidian to make a portal! I had to dismantle a nearby portal, robbing Peter to pay Paul...
Coming to the Overworld, I first saw sheep, but where were the llamas? Just as I was about to look around, I disconnected. After a while, the server restarted. I rushed in and found the llamas on a nearby hillside! I quickly messaged the leader, but he didn't reply. Several people wanted the coordinates, so I privately sent them. Later I learned the leader had messaged me not to tell anyone the coordinates, but I had already sent them to several people. The leader said it was fine - those people were all from the inner group, which relieved me. I waited here for them to arrive, but disconnected again. By this time, Chxxxing had arrived, surrounded the llamas with netherrack, and started digging the duplication tunnel.

This time I queued for a long time and missed collecting fireworks at Station #4. Before distributing supplies, the leader took a group selfie with members using a Freecam selfie stick. hadroncfy said his boxes contained dozens of shulker shells - enough to craft dozens of shulker boxes!
![Avengers Alliance group photo before supply distribution](/img/2b2t/plepon.jpg)
At 9 PM, the leader left Station #4 and headed to the llamas. When I logged in next, the tunnel was already complete, and Chxxxing had gone to Station #4. Shortly after I got online, hadroncfy arrived, but leader TBDxxx was surprisingly late. He started expanding the tunnel into a temporary small warehouse and dug out a temporary llama pen. I provided some wood, which he made into chests for storing supplies. The leader was about to start duplicating items. He said he needed people to stay away to duplicate successfully, so we moved away. After duplication, we saw dozens of shulker boxes in the chests, including lots of fireworks, 5 boxes of golden apples, and some totems. I opened one box full of golden apples. The leader said not to take any yet - the duplicated amount was still small, so leave them as "substrate" for duplication, and we could take freely once there was more. I put it back. With nothing to do, hadroncfy started decorating our base. The leader said he needed to go back for more items and asked us to watch his bed so he could respawn there, then left. Later Thxxfootxx also came. Seeing hadroncfy building, he started mining stone outside. After mining for a while, I couldn't figure out what he was doing. He said he just wanted to build a wall - yes, just a plain, flat stone wall... Later he actually started building properly, using stone bricks to lay a foundation. It got late, so I logged off. But hadroncfy accidentally posted an image with visible coordinates in the main group, then recalled it after a moment. I wondered if the mole in the group had already seen it. The next day when I logged in, the leader was also at the base. I greeted him but he didn't respond. I asked if he wanted to continue duplicating items, offering to move away to not interfere, but he still didn't respond. Then someone called Delta616 arrived. I'd never seen this ID in the group, but the leader seemed to ignore him, silently approving him as one of us.
![Llama base](/img/2b2t/2019-11-10_14.26.45.jpg)
Delta616 punched me barehanded. He had no equipment. Looking down, I saw he'd placed a sign saying "Kill me once -1". This was too strange - he could use commands to suicide. Seeing no reaction from me, he hit me again while I was still confused. Well, if he's asking for death, I'll oblige. I killed him in a few hits with a regular diamond sword. Throughout this, the leader said nothing. I went off to auto-mine redstone, since hadroncfy had mentioned wanting to make redstone lamps. Later when hadroncfy logged in, he suddenly asked me why the leader had broken all the chests. He asked in the group what happened, and the leader said the coordinates were exposed - retreat. I rushed back to investigate.
![Coordinates exposed, abandoned!](/img/2b2t/2019-11-10_14.51.37.jpg)
There was a sign at the tunnel entrance. Inside the warehouse, I saw shulker boxes scattered on the ground. Then someone came in and started placing obsidian and crystals to blow us up! First to die was Thxxfootxx who was also there, then hadroncfy ran to the other end of the tunnel. The person (FluixCarvin) chased after him. I quickly dropped my worthless items and picked up shulker boxes to put in my ender chest. Then the person came back and placed crystals on me. A totem saved my life. My best weapon was just an unenchanted diamond sword. Knowing I couldn't win but wanting to fight symbolically, I desperately swung at him a few times before dying. Before I could even click respawn, I disconnected!
![FluixCarvin pulled out end crystals](/img/2b2t/2019-11-10_14.52.28.jpg)
![I later popped a totem](/img/2b2t/2019-11-10_14.52.34.jpg)
![I was blown up!](/img/2b2t/2019-11-10_14.53.17.jpg)
Soon after, hadroncfy said in the group he was terrified and his hands were shaking... He escaped to the portal with FluixCarvin chasing into the Nether. After eating a golden apple, he jumped into lava, but FluixCarvin kept chasing, so he suicided back to spawn. The leader asked why we didn't take out crystals to fight back. Everyone said their crystals were in ender chests with no time to get them. I hadn't even gotten crystals and wouldn't know how to use them - I'd probably blow myself up. Later we learned FluixCarvin was the leader of Infinite Force! The mole must have informed them, then their leader personally came to destroy the base. hadroncfy then realized he'd messed up again - last night he accidentally posted an image with coordinates, probably seen by the mole. But I wondered if there was a spy among those who knew the coordinates? Maybe it wasn't hadroncfy's fault? But I really couldn't tell. hadroncfy had told me during supply distribution that someone called FluixCarvin had privately messaged him - maybe he was already targeted then?
![Screenshot hadroncfy sent me](/img/2b2t/FCsiid.jpg)
I wondered, is Infinite Force really this aggressive? Why must Chinese fight Chinese? I'd also seen their co-leader zackwave's videos of griefing spawn on Bilibili. Soon the mole finally revealed themselves in the group, posting a message that clarified why they came to destroy us:
>
On 10/25 xxxx openly sold second-hand Future client in Infinite Force, even though Future is hardware-locked, he still thought he could sell it second-hand. On 10/26 xxxx freeloaded items then left the group. On 10/28 I first joined this group, chatted briefly, then got kicked and they threatened to fight TCT. On 11/4 early morning, the group originally had 19 people but suddenly 300 bots joined, not sure if for psychological comfort. On 11/9 we had chosen to ignore avengers, but your spies in our group kept increasing. Chuxin even lent my account to others, causing warehouse coordinates to leak and templates to be damaged. On 11/10 Infinite Force and TCT officially declared war on Avengers.

So maybe Avengers was the aggressor? But TBDxxx was helping newcomers, providing free equipment, while Infinite Force's website said supplies required working to earn currency to buy. Free distribution breaking monopoly is good, but the work-for-pay system isn't bad either. Regarding the whole incident, I'm just a bystander who just found an organization. I don't even know what TCT is. My stance: this is beef between group leadership and them. In 2b2t's lawless environment, I remain neutral and don't hold grudges against FluixCarvin for destroying the base.
Our side also sent spies to infiltrate the opposing organization (Infinite Force's sub-group, Finite Team). One passed verification, joined, and was assigned tasks. He gave us coordinates to one of their warehouses, telling us to get some resources. I heard there were unbreakable items there. What are unbreakable items? They don't need XP to repair and can never break! I heard they were glitched using the paid client Future. I guess they might be items with -32768 durability. 32k swords were banned by the admin long ago, but unbreakables still exist. But I was still in queue and worried if someone was there, my PvP skills would get me destroyed. (I'm completely terrible at PvP - the only person I killed was Delta616 when he asked me to kill him.) I heard they also found precious Alpha Leaves blocks from early game versions that had lost their textures!
![Alpha Leaves](/img/2b2t/alphaleaves.png)

Later someone in the inner group said they'd already blown up that warehouse and posted a picture full of TNT.![Boom boom boom! (image from group)](/img/2b2t/blebleble.jpg)
Later, videos about that warehouse appeared on Bilibili! None were posted by our people (later confirmed all were from Infinite Force). The content was basically "Found a fat warehouse in 2b2t, jackpot!" Only the comments mentioned the warehouse was destroyed. Turns out this warehouse wasn't even Infinite Force's - they just stumbled upon someone else's. According to [Brother Li's video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av75152103), he deduced the original owner was probably American.
![](/img/2b2t/bneud.jpg)
I only logged back in a day later. Upon logging in, I saw the death screen, which was normal since I remember not clicking respawn before disconnecting last time. But the surroundings had changed dramatically - my death screen had updated to the bottom of the blast crater. Clicking respawn, I was back at spawn.
But now I was different from a newcomer - my ender chest was full of shulker boxes. I decided to sightsee around spawn first. I found a canal enclosed by obsidian. Walking along, a torch-lit bridge caught my attention - this must be newly built, otherwise the torches would've been removed. Looking up, I saw an exquisite hole in the stone mountain above!
![Exquisite hole in the stone mountain above the bridge](/img/2b2t/2019-11-11_22.47.14.jpg)
I quickly used freecam to check above and struck gold! It was a memorial hall with many decorative rare items like heads! Going up, I found a dragon egg in the corner! But I knew punching the dragon egg wouldn't work - it would teleport elsewhere. hadroncfy had said before to dig underneath, place a torch at the bottom, then break the block under the egg so it falls onto the torch and becomes an item. But I had no torches (actually there were many on the bridge below, I forgot). I suddenly remembered skulls are also non-solid blocks, so I successfully caught the dragon egg with a skeleton skull, earning the advancement "The Next Generation".
![Skulls, dragon egg, and crafting table cross](/img/2b2t/2019-11-11_22.47.59.jpg)
I continued along the canal - it was really long! I think I remember hearing 2b2t's biggest project is the -Z canal, built out to several million blocks! Supposedly the largest-scale project in all of Minecraft. I followed it for a long distance. I saw many chests nearby. Though most were empty, one chest had 6 enchanted golden apples! Seeing what looked like more structures ahead, I walked forward, but suddenly saw a player there! My first reaction was to frantically run away, not even knowing if that player was a newcomer! So I continued following the canal, thinking after a day that player might have left and I could check again.
![The great obsidian canal](/img/2b2t/2019-11-12_22.20.08.jpg)
Later I entered the Nether, walked some distance, came out and saw the canal still extending forward. Long past aesthetic fatigue, I walked perpendicular to the canal and left. Soon after, I regretted it. Why didn't I travel through the Nether? I walked for ages without seeing anyone. Lots of ocean around, I didn't want to waste more time walking in the Overworld. Finally, after a long time, I found a portal. Going through, I headed straight for hadroncfy's coordinates. He said he was just AFKing there, hadn't even built a base. When I arrived, I wanted to try using elytra with fireworks, but after many attempts I couldn't fly, so I gave up.
The next day hadroncfy was queuing when something came up and he left. When he returned, he found he'd already logged in and died, respawning near a historical building called Long Long Ranch he'd seen before. Meanwhile, I placed two chests underground (I can't provide screenshots for fear of discovery), deliberately arranged to look like a dungeon for storing fireworks and totems I'd taken from the llama base. This way people with chest ESP hacks would think it's just a dungeon. Though closer inspection would reveal no spawner, I figured nobody would be that bored, especially since spawners are everywhere and this was 100k+ blocks out, quite far. After burying the chests, I returned to the Nether, planning to return to spawn and wait for the leader to distribute supplies. This time I didn't want to suicide back - first, I didn't want to navigate out of chaotic terrain again, and second, I wanted to check portals along the way. Many portals had nothing on the other side, but using freecam in the 120-high tunnel, I saw two portals connected by rails at the bottom of a cliff!
Out of curiosity, I had to check. Entering, I immediately saw many chests inside the mountain! Going in, I found a group of donkeys and llamas! Obviously a duplication storage base.
![](/img/2b2t/2019-11-14_20.17.09.jpg)
But unfortunately it was long abandoned. Even the donkey chests contained junk like netherrack and wheat seeds. There were also many villagers. When I told hadroncfy, he asked if any sold mending books. Looking around, there actually was one! But it cost over 20 emeralds, which neither of us had. Of course, mending is dirt cheap in 2b2t like other god items. I also went to the other Nether portal connected by rails - it led to a village with nothing valuable around. I told hadroncfy he could come if he wanted, but I was continuing to the Nether.
I returned to the previously bombed llama base. Now there were only craters and many banners. I guessed they were Infinite Force banners (I didn't recognize their banners, but later discovered they weren't!). Even the 170-block duplication tunnel had only a small section left.
![Base before bombing](/img/2b2t/metob_jototui.jpg)
![Base after bombing](/img/2b2t/2019-11-14_21.36.33.jpg)
By now the leader had announced supply station coordinates. I knew this location wouldn't last long since the group mole would definitely tell Infinite Force. So I suicided back directly. On the way, I actually found an empty shulker box! My first time finding a shulker box myself. About 1k from the destination, I heard in the group that someone called Zackwave came to destroy it. I knew him - another Infinite Force leader and a Bilibili content creator. When I reached those coordinates, it was just another crater. Late again! I decided to wait where supplies were often distributed (X- Z-) and not go anywhere else for now. But first I needed to find a safe place to sleep. So I entered the Nether and wandered around. When I walked to a highway hub, I didn't notice a missing obsidian block underfoot and fell to my death! My first death due to carelessness. Fortunately I had no items on me, so no loss.
![Nether highway hub](/img/2b2t/2019-11-14_22.49.33.jpg)
I returned to spawn and logged off at the TNT-bombed canyon at X=-2k, thinking it was close to where they often distributed supplies. Later the leader said his priority queue expired, and the Saturday 8 PM supply distribution wasn't publicly announced in the group, so I decided to develop on my own instead of waiting for supplies. Before going far, Impact alerted me to a shulker box under the ice! I quickly used Freecam to check and found a yellow shulker box! Going down, I saw it contained some PvP supplies. After storing in my ender chest, I decided to go to the donkey and llama place I'd discovered. So I walked further, away from spawn before entering a portal. On the way, I tried elytra again and succeeded this time! Last time's failure was probably due to server lag and low TPS (server tick rate). After flying briefly, I entered the Nether to travel. At X=-1k I saw an obsidian highway. This wasn't on an axis or diagonal - could there be ring highways? I figured ring highways should have fewer people and less chance of encountering murderers, so I followed the highway. Then I saw another shulker box! This box was by a portal below a cliff. To find a path down, I used freecam for ages before finding a suitable route. This box was well-stocked and even had melon seeds! Seems the owner was a kind person who planted melon farms for newcomers. I returned to the highway and at the diagonal hub found the highway really did turn at a right angle! I continued toward the newly discovered llama base. Along the way at 5k and 10k there were obsidian highways! Besides axis and diagonal highways, there were so many ring roads! I never knew before.
After arriving at that place, I rode away a donkey. I worried being too close to the portal was too conspicuous. I also circled the area several times - first to check terrain, second to load new chunks so nobody could track me through new chunks.
After settling down, I started digging a tunnel but disconnected halfway through. But disconnecting wasn't a loss since Impact isn't good for duping - I hadn't downloaded WWE (another duping-specific client) yet. So I downloaded and installed WWE, wanting to test in single player first. But every time I used freecam to go to unloaded chunks, they wouldn't load no matter how long I waited. Could it only work on servers? But the server seemed to be under maintenance and I couldn't connect. I really worried Hause was fixing the donkey duping bug - that would be really unlucky.
After getting in, I continued digging the tunnel. But I realized I hadn't even brought an ender chest. The tunnel was pitch black because I'd been using the light hack (fullbright) before. Now with WWE, I couldn't even find the "lights" (fullbright) function. So I returned to the abandoned base. On the way, I noticed hunger depleted really fast. After searching forever, I finally found WWE's anti-hunger function, but couldn't find fullbright anywhere. At least I finally turned on ESP (entity highlighting) so I'd know where mobs were. Back at the tunnel, after building and placing bed, chests, etc., I started duping.
![Trying Donkey Dupe with new client WWE](/img/2b2t/2019-11-18_18.09.03.jpg)
But same bug as before - freecam reaching chunk edge wouldn't load. I had to restart. One time the chunks ahead loaded! But I could still see my real body, so I continued forward. But the new chunks flickered instead of staying visible like in videos. Soon I disconnected. Logging back in, I tried again with the same result and disconnected again. Seems I really got kicked - did Hause patch it? I asked in the main group. klubxxxd said he had priority queue so wouldn't disconnect and could help dupe. He said he had dupe materials. We could make more bases, but he also said WWE had a backdoor so we'd need to run after duping. But I still leaned toward Infinite Force trying to scare us. Today the inner group suddenly said they were deleted by the leader! The group dissolved! Did the organization just disband like that, with the leader running away? Nobody knew what happened. Though with so many moles, maybe they wanted to recruit fresh. Oh right, just a few days ago, the first player I saw - dtEnglish (whose brother killed me while he was AFK) had already defected to Infinite Force! Of course, I always maintained a neutral stance.
kxxxd and hadroncfy arrived around the same time. I met them in the Nether and brought them to the base. Since I'd taken the base's only saddle, we went directly to my built tunnel. I asked klubxxxd if he needed materials, but he said he wasn't very familiar with WWE and would try duping first.
We went to a fairly distant location. We waited over an hour but he couldn't dupe anything. Later the server restarted and I logged off. One second after I clicked disconnect, he said duplication succeeded. Later hadroncfy checked the tunnel and found no supplies, even the donkey was gone! Did I give klubxxxd the donkey and he rode off? I asked if he moved the donkey. He said no, he logged off riding it, so maybe the donkey logged off with him. Before he logged back in, I went to see the house hadroncfy built replicating GoldenEggs' [interactive video "You're Stuck on October 25, 2019"](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av73267982) and checked the "fake dungeon" I made before - supplies were still there, nobody had been there.
![hadroncfy's replica of the "October 25th" house](/img/2b2t/2019-11-19_14.38.10.jpg)
After klubxxxd logged in to continue duping, he got stuck by a bug and could only suicide back to spawn, taking 1 hour to return. hadroncfy and I went to the tunnel and saw the donkey was indeed still there with quite a few material shulker boxes. We planned to first go to the original location to build a warehouse to store items duped here, since this place wasn't safe - what if there really was a backdoor? Initially we agreed to build underground, but klubxxxd said building in the sky was better. Though there would be shadows on the ground, above 200 blocks they couldn't be seen. Building underground, ESP chest X-ray would easily find it. But we'd already started underground construction, so we kept the warehouse underground.
![Newly built underground warehouse](/img/2b2t/2019-11-20_22.15.44.jpg)
These days I worked as a truck driver: transporting batches of duped items from the donkey to the warehouse. Though there's auto-navigation, it's not very useful in the Nether because I traveled through tunnels others dug near y=120. These tunnels are 98% horizontal/vertical, so if my destination was diagonal, auto-navigation would veer off to dig walls diagonally. Later I manually recorded turn coordinates, navigating in segments to ensure each navigation target was in the facing direction.
![Item duplication tunnel](/img/2b2t/2019-11-20_21.34.57.jpg)
On the weekend, klubxxxd said we must move the donkey. After moving and organizing, he was preparing for a long journey. He said he had many interesting coordinates, including an active sub-base of the Imperials (one of 2b2t's largest groups)! I happened to be busy that weekend when moving the donkey. Plus the long queues and boring monotonous supply transport life greatly reduced my enthusiasm. Looking at box after box of full unbreakable items, I no longer felt the original excitement. After that, I never logged in again.
During my absence, the original inner group (original leader TBDxxx had left and disappeared) said they wanted to re-establish an organization, so they created another public group. This group was far less lively than before, and the new leader's (Chxxxing) new policy was also not wanting to oppose Infinite Force, which I thought was good - after all, they're both Chinese groups. But the new group was also very quiet. You could say this organizational conflict had ended, which is why I dared to publish this article. During this time I only watched some 2b2t videos, but [one video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av77020304) caught my attention! It mentioned an organization called Yakuza that specifically griefs servers and destroys bases. I noticed this organization's banner was the same as what I saw at the bombed llama base! So our base was bombed in Yakuza's name, not Infinite Force! Actually, I'd seen the word yakuza in certain unspeakable chat logs before (privacy! privacy!) and asked what it was. Now it should be clear - Infinite Force has connections with yakuza, but I really don't understand FluixCarvin's motivation for doing this.
**Conclusion:**
Finally, the 2b2t server series should end here. Because rather than calling 2b2t an anarchy server, it's more like a pay-to-win server. First, people who buy priority queue can instantly join while regular players wait hours. Second, though there's free Impact client, it can't compare to paid Future client. So I decided to stop playing 2b2t, though I don't rule out occasionally revisiting. Now hadroncfy has reopened the previous creative server, and I've decided to start building cities. hadroncfy's new survival server is also connected to the creative server through Bungeecord, collectively called DichuuCraft. The survival server's development direction is similar to TIS server's technical survival. I'll also find time to build some redstone machines. In the future, I'll write articles introducing DichuuCraft's creative and survival worlds. (Of course, content about the fourth dimension will also be updated.)

## Updates
### March 2020
Later, Brother Li (lizhenglun) from Infinite Force posted a video about [Infinite Force organization](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av88806679), mentioning their first base was actually destroyed by yakuza organization. So I speculate at the llama base, FluixCarvin bombed it and left, then yakuza privately went to place banners. That video also mentioned leader TBDxxx defected from Infinite Force to establish Avengers Alliance independently, and after war broke out, TBDxxx just vanished into thin air within days. Also seems their co-leader Zackwave stepped back (supposedly due to internal conflicts). During this time I still haven't logged into 2B2T.
### August 2020
Recently Brother Li and Dirty Bean's video introducing 2b2t's largest Chinese organization Infinite Force mentioned the Avengers Alliance leader defected from Infinite Force. The war that erupted was actually FluixCarvin coming to bomb the llama base I discovered - the images in the video were screenshots I took before being killed! Even more amazing, under Zackwave's video about his newly established Infinite Matrix fighting Infinite Force ([video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fK411V7E9)), I saw this comment:

klubbland was also a mole!? I happened to have chatted with klubbland before. He said he never joined Infinite Force but always followed Zackwave. But when the llama base was bombed, Zackwave hadn't split from Infinite Force yet, so klubbland was definitely a mole. Of course, I don't hold any critical attitude toward him. I believe there were even more moles in the group at that time. I'm lucky to have experienced major events in 2b2t's Chinese community. I also got lots of supplies from the llama base and didn't participate in any combat (except that time with FluixCarvin).
