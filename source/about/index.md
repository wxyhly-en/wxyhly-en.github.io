## About English Translation
This website is originally written in Chinese (accesible in navigation bar). Thanks to **[Ilya Sheprut](https://github.com/optozorax)** for helping me creating this English website by AI and guiding me using GitHub Actions to automate blog updates. I'm revising all the AI translations, still in progress.
